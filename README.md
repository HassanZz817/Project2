# Project2
I used various CSS styles that I learned and tried to put it in a nice way 
this is my seconed project that I have ever did <h1> It's all about the Curves ~ </h1>

I used two  Resources in this project 
1- https://heropatterns.com/
I used it for the backgorund patterns
2- https://www.shapedivider.app/
for the wave style that cuts the background image
